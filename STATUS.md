# ISKCON Student Club Website - Status Update

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State

### âœ… What's Working:
- **Main Website**: Beautiful homepage with static content at `/`
- **Test Environment**: Dynamic content testing at `/test-dynamic`
- **Admin Panel**: Two versions available:
  - `/admin` - Full-featured (requires Vercel storage)
  - `/simple-admin` - Test mode (works without storage)
- **API Routes**: Both main and fallback APIs implemented

### ðŸ”§ What's Happening Now:

The admin panel shows errors because:
1. **No Vercel Storage**: The production APIs need Vercel KV (database) and Blob (file storage)
2. **Text Visibility**: Some form inputs need better styling
3. **Upload Failures**: Expected without proper storage setup

## ðŸš€ Next Steps:

### Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended)
1. Visit `/simple-admin` - A simplified admin that works immediately
2. Test adding/editing announcements and images
3. View results at `/test-dynamic`

### Option 2: Full Production Setup
1. Set up Vercel KV and Blob storage
2. Add environment variables
3. Use the full `/admin` panel

## ðŸŽ¨ Integration Ready

Your main page (`page.tsx`) is untouched and ready for integration. When you're satisfied with the dynamic content testing, we can easily replace the static carousel and announcements with the dynamic versions.

## ðŸ”— Quick Links:
- [Main Site](/) - Your beautiful homepage
- [Simple Admin](/simple-admin) - Test admin panel (no setup required)
- [Test Dynamic](/test-dynamic) - See dynamic content in action
- [CMS Demo](/cms-demo) - Integration documentation

## ðŸ’¡ The Plan:

1. **Test First**: Use `/simple-admin` to test the CMS features
2. **Verify**: Check dynamic content at `/test-dynamic` 
3. **Integrate**: Replace static content in main page with dynamic components
4. **Deploy**: Set up Vercel storage for production

This approach keeps your main site safe while you test the new features!
